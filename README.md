# Kahoot Hack

**NOTE**: I have not maintained these tools for a while. I have heard reports that they are broken. If anybody wants to fix them, be my guest. But I do not intend to.

I hope to use this tool to "hack" [kahoot.it](http://kahoot.it) in order to win at every game I play.

## Tools included

Currently, I have implemented the following tools:

 * crasher.go - freeze the game of kahoot irreversibly
 * flood.go - flood a lobby with a ton of bogus nicknames
 * regular.go - play the game regularly, answering questions as you progress

# Dependencies

    go get github.com/gorilla/websocket
